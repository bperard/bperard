  <p>When I'm developing an idea, I like to design features that are non-specific to their application. Modular thinking & code allows you to create systems that can grow organically as you learn more, innovation strikes, and/or necessity comes into play. Collaboration is one of my favorite ways to learn while developing, and to improve my ability to create & communicate new ideas; working toward creating a shared idea is exciting & inspiring. I want my developing to be a part of creating joy for the people and communities I love.<p>
